# Canadian COVID-19 Tracking and Lifestyle Trends data mart Analysis

Lockdown measures were enforced in Canada and many other countries, leaving residents with no alternative but to adapt their lifestyles accordingly. People are increasingly turning to online buying, while outdoor activities are becoming more popular. Many non-essential businesses, particularly in the hospitality industry, reacted by solely offering delivery or curbside pickup, resulting in shifts in consumer behaviour and traffic patterns.
The present shift in Canadians' habits, particularly as it relates to the ebb and flow of Covid-19 cases, merits additional investigation. Indeed, it is critical to investigate behavioural changes, analyse the pandemic's impact, and make plans for the future.

There are 4 phases of this project:
